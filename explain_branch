 A branch is essentially a pointer that points to the last commit you made. If you create a new branch from a master directory, that new branch will contain all
 of the files from the master diretory however any edits made to the new branch will not be reflected in the master directory. It is however possible to merge branches
 so that any changes made in one branch can be applied to the master branch when you feel ready to do so. Branching is a safe of way working on a new (and perhaps
 unstable) aspect of a project whilst keeping the core intact.
